## West & Harrison

- Chapter 8
    - algebra: 3, 5, 6(a), 9, 10, 
    - code: **13**, 14, 15, 16
        - for 13, "allow user to select any number of harmonic components"
        - does that mean that the user can choose which harmonics?
        - if not, than if the user chooses 3 harmonics out of 12, which 3 should be chosen?
        - plot the periodogram of the data and see if the most important frequencies are the most important harmonics?
- Chapter 9
    - algebra: 9
    - code: 3, 4(a), 
- Chapter 10
    - algebra: 2
    - code: 1(a)-(b) and 1(d), 7
