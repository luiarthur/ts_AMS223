For each of the Chapter 1 datasets posted in the data dir: 
  1. plot the data
  2. plot the sample autocorrelation functions. For the SOI series: smooth the series using moving averages (try different orders and weights). For the USA GDP time series: plot the first and second differences and the corresponding sample autocorrelation functions. 

Comments about the homework:

Problem 5: assume that $\omega_0$'s are fixed.

Problem 7: assume that $d=1$ and work with the conditional likelihood.
